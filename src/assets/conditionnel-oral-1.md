## **Le conditionnel**

Go through the table of conjugations in the description for the
lessons. Read each on out loud three times. Then try and quiz yourself
to remember the verb endings, out loud.

Once you're confident in your ability to remember the verb endings,
create some simple sentences off the top of your head, crafting them
out loud.
