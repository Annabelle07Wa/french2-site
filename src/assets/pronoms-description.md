## **Les pronoms diréct et indiréct**

*The direct and indirect object pronouns.*
Pronouns are the words we use as replacements for the names of nouns. "I met *Ralph*" turns into "I met *him*." In english, the pronoun comes **after** the verb. In French, the opposite is true; the pronoun comes **before** the verb.

In french there are direct and indirect object pronouns, the *complément d’objet direct* (COD) and the *complément d’objet indirect* (COI). A COD refers to the direct object of the sentence: the person or thing to which the action is done. A COI refers to the indirect object of the sentence.

For CODs, ask the question "**Who? or What?**"
For COIs: COIs are are the people or things in a sentence **to or for whom/what** the action of the verb occurs.
